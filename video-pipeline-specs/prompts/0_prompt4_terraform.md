Create a comprehensive Terraform standards and best practices document for my cloud infrastructure project. The document should cover:

1. File organization with a modular structure that includes separate directories for environments (dev and prod) and modules for different resource types (s3, lambda, etc.)

2. Naming conventions for resources, variables, and files that promote consistency and clarity

3. Module structure guidelines including required files and their purpose

4. Tagging strategy for resources to ensure proper organization and cost tracking

5. State management recommendations including remote state configuration and best practices

6. Security practices for storing sensitive information and implementing least privilege

7. Code quality standards including formatting, validation, and review processes

8. Variable definition standards with examples of proper documentation

9. Version pinning guidelines for providers and modules

10. Documentation requirements for modules and infrastructure components

11. CI/CD integration recommendations for automated testing and deployment

12. Change management practices to ensure safe infrastructure updates

13. Testing strategies for infrastructure code

14. Cost management and optimization approaches

Please format the document in Markdown with clear section headers, code examples for all key concepts, and real-world examples that would be applicable to a video processing pipeline built on AWS. Include specific guidelines for S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and other AWS services typically used in media processing pipelines.
