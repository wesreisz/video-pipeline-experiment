# Text Processing and Embedding Endpoint Prompt

I need a detailed design for a system that processes approximately 90 recorded audio files from a software conference. The solution should meet the following requirements and incorporate AWS managed services wherever possible:

1. **Audio Ingestion and Triggering:**
   - The audio files are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.
   - Use S3 event notifications (or EventBridge) to trigger the processing workflow immediately upon upload.

2. **Workflow Orchestration using AWS Step Functions:**
   - Orchestrate the multi-step process using AWS Step Functions.
   - The workflow should include:
     - Initiating an audio transcription job.
     - Polling for transcription completion.
     - Retrieving and processing the transcript.
     - Chunking the transcript into smaller segments (by sentence, paragraph, or fixed token length).
     - Generating embeddings for each text chunk.
     - Storing the embeddings (with metadata) in a vector database.
   - Each step should be implemented as AWS Lambda functions integrated into the Step Functions workflow.
   - Include error handling, retries, and parallel processing where applicable.

3. **Audio Transcription:**
   - Use Amazon Transcribe to convert audio files to text.
   - Design a Lambda function that starts the transcription job and another task (or a polling mechanism) to check for transcription completion.

4. **Text Processing and Chunking:**
   - Create a Lambda function to retrieve the completed transcript.
   - Implement a chunking algorithm that splits the transcript into manageable chunks for embedding generation.
   - Store chunks with metadata (such as original file name, chunk index, etc.).

5. **Embedding Generation:**
   - Use AWS SageMaker to deploy a pre-trained text embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, BERT, or similar) to generate embeddings for each text chunk.
   - Alternatively, if the model is lightweight, a Lambda function could generate the embeddings.
   - Process each chunk either in parallel (using Step Functionsâ€™ parallel or map states) or sequentially.

6. **Storing in a Vector Database:**
   - Index the embeddings and metadata in a vector database.
   - Options include:
     - Amazon OpenSearch Service with kNN plugin.
     - Third-party managed services like Pinecone or Weaviate.
   - A Lambda function should handle the insertion of embedding data into the chosen vector database.

7. **Querying via API Gateway and Integration with an LLM:**
   - Expose an HTTP endpoint using Amazon API Gateway.
   - A Lambda function triggered by API Gateway should:
     - Accept a user query.
     - Search the vector database for the top-N similar chunks.
     - Assemble the relevant context from the retrieved chunks.
     - Pass the query and context to a large language model (LLM) endpoint (which could be hosted on SageMaker or accessed via an external API) for further processing.
     - Return the final answer to the user.
   
8. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Include proper IAM role configurations and security measures.
   - Implement logging and monitoring using CloudWatch.
   - Provide pseudocode examples:
     - A Lambda function for starting the transcription job.
     - A simplified Step Functions state machine definition in Amazon States Language.
     - A Lambda function for handling user queries via API Gateway that performs vector database search and LLM querying.

Please generate a solution specification that covers all the above points with clear architectural diagrams, workflow descriptions, and pseudocode examples where appropriate.

This prompt covers the entire architecture, details the use of AWS Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, and other services, and requests pseudocode examples to illustrate the key parts of the system.
